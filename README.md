## Modules 
### network_functions 
This module just has a couple of network based functions. 
a. add_num(a,b)
   Input: Two numbers a and b. 
   Output: Sum of these numbers 
The purpose of this function is just to test that you have imported the package successfully. 

b. degree_distribution(G, number_of_bins=15, log_binning=True, density=True, directed=False)
   Input: 
   G = Networkx graph 
   number_of_bins = Number of bins can be adjusted by the user according to the graph 
   log_binning = if True, implements log binning. If False, implements linear binning 
   density = if True, returns probability density. If False, returns counts 
   directed = True if your network is directed and false if it isnt. 

   Output: 
   Array (probability densitiy/counts, bins)

c. plot_degree_distribution(G, number_of_bins=15, log_binning=True, density=True, directed=False)
   Input: 
   G = Networkx graph 
   Same as degree distribution
   Output:
   A matplotlib plot of degree distribution. 

d. configuration_model_from_degree_sequence(G, return_simple=True)
   Input: 
   G = Networkx Graph 
   Output: 
   Randomized graph based on configuration model

### Openalex_data
a. fetch_results_mini(url, p1, p2, mailto)
   url: API query from the OpenAlex website (remove the part page=1 if you want to access more than 1 pages)
   p1: Starting page number (25 results per page)
   p2: ENding page number 
   mailto: you email id (in double quotes)
   Output: 
   List of all the results. This function can only access upto first 75000 results in the API query. 

b. fetch_results_in_range(base_url, start, end, mailto):
   base_url = API query from the OpenAlex website (remove the part page=1 if you want to access more than 1 pages)
   start = Starting record number 
   end = ending record number (end - start =< 100000)
   mailto = you email id 
   Output: 
   List of all your results. 

c. save_to_json(data, filename)
   Input: 
   data = list (generated by above functions) containing all the results from API 
   Output: 
   JSON data file 

d. institution_collaborations(all_data)
   Input: 
   all_data = List of all results from API query 
   Output:
   Dictionary of collaboration between universities i.e. University 1, University 2 : weight. 

e. load_from_json(filename)
   Input: 
   filename= JSON file 
   Output:
   Contents of the file imported in List format.
